# PART 4: Basic Data Insight Interpretation
Question:

Which region contributes most revenue?
  - The West region contributes the highest revenue.
Which product category performs best?
  - Electronics is the top-performing category.
Are sales consistent across dates?
  - No. Sales show a significant decline from 2024 to 2025.
What business recommendation can you suggest?
  - The company should investigate the sharp sales decline in 2025 by analyzing possible causes such as seasonality, marketing reductions, supply issues, or pricing changes, and reviewing monthly trends to identify when the drop began. Greater focus should be placed on expanding and promoting Electronics, including bundle offers with Furniture to increase sales value. Performance in the North region should be improved through targeted promotions and evaluation of distribution and pricing strategies. Office Supplies sales can be strengthened through discounts, bulk or subscription models, and cross-selling efforts. Finally, consistent sales monitoring and clear performance indicators should be implemented to detect and address future declines early.
